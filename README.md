# Scaling and Load Balancing Your Architecture

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to utilize Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to effectively load balance and automatically scale your infrastructure. ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, providing the necessary load balancing capacity to help achieve fault tolerance in your applications.

Auto Scaling ensures that your application remains available and operates at the optimal number of Amazon EC2 instances by automatically adjusting capacity based on the conditions you define. This feature is ideal for applications with stable demand patterns or those experiencing variability in usage on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. It helps maintain performance during demand spikes and reduce costs during quieter periods by scaling out or in as needed.
